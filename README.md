# Shapes2

This is  a Continuatin of the Project Shapes
In the earlier project we learnt how to use basic git commands.
In this Project we are going to consider Another project which is public and contribute to this.

We will be using my Second Github Account to understand the Process of pull request and merging

Steps To Be followed for creating the proejct are:
PHASE 1:
  Consider a Public Repo and fork the repo - -a copy of that repo is presetn inyour github repositories
  Now clone this Forked Repo onto your local computer -- git clone http_link
  Do the Changes and then push it back to the Repo -- git push origin master
  Now these changes are only reflected in your repository to get it done in original repository
  In contribute Section - Create a Pull request
  The admin of the main repo has to check and then he will approve or reject
  If Approved then your changes wil lbe merged onto the proejct and you can see your commits on the main project repo
  This will make your First Contribution.

PHASE 2:
ABOUT CREATING NEW BRANCHES AND WORKING ON A FUNCTIONALITY AND MERGING THE BRANCH


Steps To Be followed for creating the proejct are:
  Create a new Branch for each Functionality of the shapes -- git checkout -b branch_name
  Change / Switch to the Branch you are working on new functionality - git checkout branch_name
  To View all the branches present -- git branch
  Do all the required Changes by going to each branch - Also commit the changes done
  To merge a branch we have to be on the branch where we are merging the branch - git merge branch_name
  After merging it is a good idea to delete the branch if we are sure that we will not use the branch again in future - git branch -D branch_name
  
  After the merging all the commits will be reflected in the main branch itself.
